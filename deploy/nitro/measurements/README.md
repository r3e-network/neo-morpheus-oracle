# Enclave measurements (PCR manifests)

Each `<release>.json` here is the **pinned source of truth** for one Morpheus
Oracle enclave EIF release: the PCR0/1/2 measurements that the attestation
verifier compares against an enclave's live attestation document. If the live
document's PCRs do not match the committed manifest, the verifier rejects it —
that is what proves an enclave runs the genuine, reviewed oracle code.

## How a manifest is produced

`deploy/nitro/build-enclave-eif.sh` (run on the Nitro box) builds the merged
enclave image (`Dockerfile.enclave`), runs `nitro-cli build-enclave`, captures
its `Measurements` JSON, and writes `deploy/nitro/measurements/<release>.json`.
The script **fails if any PCR is empty** so an empty/garbage manifest can never
be committed.

```
# on the box, from the repo root:
MORPHEUS_RELEASE=oracle-2026-06-14 MORPHEUS_NETWORK=testnet \
  bash deploy/nitro/build-enclave-eif.sh
git add deploy/nitro/measurements/oracle-2026-06-14.json   # review the PCRs, then commit
```

## Why it is committed in-repo

Serving the manifest only from the Morpheus server the user is trying NOT to
trust is circular. Committing it makes the expected measurements **reviewable in
version control** and shippable to the client-side verifier as a static asset.
The API route (`apps/web/app/api/attestation/measurements`, Phase 2) serves this
same committed file; the offline/in-browser verifier ships its own pinned copy.

## Reproducibility — why these PCRs are independently verifiable

PCR0/1/2 are derived deterministically from the docker image. The image is
reproducible by construction (`Dockerfile.enclave`): digest-pinned base images,
`npm ci` from the committed `package-lock.json`, a pinned Go module
(`nsm-attest/go.mod` + `go.sum`), and `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` + normalized mtimes.
Anyone can rebuild the EIF off the recorded `git_commit` and confirm the same
PCRs. Verify the docker layer is reproducible locally with:

```
bash deploy/nitro/build-enclave-eif.sh --verify-reproducible --no-eif
```

(`--no-eif` skips `nitro-cli`, which is box-only; `--verify-reproducible` builds
the docker image twice and asserts identical image IDs.)

## Manifest schema

See `manifest.schema.json` (JSON Schema, draft 2020-12) for the authoritative
shape and `example.json` for a filled-in (illustrative, NON-REAL) example.

| field          | type            | meaning                                                        |
|----------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `release`      | string          | release id, e.g. `oracle-2026-06-14`                           |
| `app_id`       | string          | always `morpheus-oracle`                                       |
| `network`      | string          | `testnet` \| `mainnet`                                         |
| `git_commit`   | string          | full commit SHA the EIF was built from                         |
| `image_id`     | string \| null  | docker image id (`sha256:...`) the EIF was built from          |
| `eif_sha256`   | string \| null  | sha256 of the `.eif` file                                      |
| `hash_algorithm` | string        | PCR hash algorithm, always `SHA384` for Nitro                  |
| `pcr0`         | string (hex 96) | enclave image measurement (kernel + app)                       |
| `pcr1`         | string (hex 96) | Linux kernel + bootstrap measurement                           |
| `pcr2`         | string (hex 96) | application measurement                                        |
| `pcr8`         | string (hex 96), optional | signing-cert measurement (only if the EIF is signed) |
| `built_at`     | string          | ISO-8601 UTC build timestamp                                   |

PCR values are SHA384 → 48 bytes → 96 lowercase hex characters.

## Rotation

A new EIF release = a new manifest file (do not edit an old one in place).
The verifier's pinned-manifest set is updated by an explicit, reviewed code
change — never fetched/trusted at runtime.
