# MorpheusOracle Kernel In-Place Upgrade (OR-D-01 + OR-D-03/N3)

Ships the prepared kernel generation onto the deployed hash
`0xf54d8584ef82315c1800373272ab08ae0db2d5ef` (same hash on testnet AND mainnet,
both currently `updatecounter=0`) via the contract's admin-gated
`update(nefFile, manifest)` -> `ContractManagement.Update`. Storage persists across
the update; the contract hash does NOT change, so no client or relayer config needs
repointing.

What this generation adds over the deployed one (verified by the upgrade script's
method diff):

| Change | Why |
| --- | --- |
| `reservedRequestFees` / `withdrawableFees` + reserve-gated `withdrawAccruedFees` | The deployed kernel lets the admin withdraw fees that back pending requests, shrinking expiry refunds. |
| O(1) callback reverse index + `rebuildIndexes(start, count)` backfill | The deployed kernel resolves `request`/`requestFromCallback` with an O(n) registry scan (per-request DoS as the registry grows). |
| Callback-uniqueness assert in `PutMiniApp` (`"callback already registered"`) | Without it the new O(1) index is last-write-wins: any account could register a fresh appId over an existing app's callback and repoint/brick its legacy request routing (the N3 half of OR-D-03; the EVM half is bytecode-frozen, see `docs/runbooks/callback-monitor.md`). |

## Tooling

`scripts/upgrade-morpheus-oracle.mjs` - DRY RUN by default (read-only RPC):

```sh
# Preview: deployed vs local checksum/method diff, gas estimate, rebuild chunk plan.
# Also archives the CURRENT on-chain NEF+manifest (the rollback artifact) to
# private-backups/upgrades/morpheus-oracle.<network>.uc<N>.<timestamp>.*
node scripts/upgrade-morpheus-oracle.mjs --network testnet

# Send the update transaction (admin key required; post-update reads run automatically)
UPGRADE_APPLY=1 MORPHEUS_ORACLE_ADMIN_WIF=... node scripts/upgrade-morpheus-oracle.mjs --network testnet

# Backfill the new reverse indexes in chunks, then verify them via getstorage
REBUILD_APPLY=1 MORPHEUS_ORACLE_ADMIN_WIF=... node scripts/upgrade-morpheus-oracle.mjs --network testnet --batch-size 16
```

Signer: `MORPHEUS_ORACLE_ADMIN_WIF` (falls back to the repo's pinned `updater` role
key). The script refuses to send if the signer's script hash is not the on-chain
`admin()` - note the gate is the ADMIN, not the updater (on mainnet they differ:
admin `0x6d0656f6...`, updater `0x9fb28bda...`). Rebuild the local artifact first
(`contracts/build.sh`); the script reads `contracts/build/MorpheusOracle.{nef,manifest.json}`.

## Order of operations

1. **Testnet update** - `node scripts/upgrade-morpheus-oracle.mjs --network testnet`
   (dry run, confirm: `methods_added` is exactly `reservedRequestFees`,
   `withdrawableFees`, `rebuildIndexes`; preview `state=HALT`; archive written), then
   re-run with `UPGRADE_APPLY=1`. The script verifies `updatecounter` incremented,
   the new checksum landed, the fee views answer, and a `getMiniApp` probe still
   returns the pre-update record.
2. **Examples smoke (testnet)** - `node scripts/smoke-oracle-n3.mjs` and the
   callback-boundary suites under `examples/scripts/` (`test-n3-examples.mjs`,
   `test-n3-aa-callback-replay-boundary.mjs`) to prove submit -> fulfill -> callback
   still round-trips on the upgraded kernel with the live relayer signer.
3. **RebuildIndexes backfill (testnet)** - re-run with `REBUILD_APPLY=1`. Until this
   runs, the legacy entry points (`request`, `requestFromCallback`,
   `queueAutomationRequest`) cannot resolve PRE-EXISTING integration contracts (the
   new index prefix starts empty) and directed fee deposits to pre-existing sponsors
   are rejected; `submitMiniAppRequest` by appId is unaffected. Backfill is chunked
   (`--batch-size`), idempotent, and safe to re-run/resume. The script then verifies
   every callback mapping on-chain via `getstorage`.
4. **Mainnet update** - same two steps with `--network mainnet`. Triple-gate: dry
   run first, check the archive file exists, then `UPGRADE_APPLY=1`.
5. **Mainnet verification reads + backfill** - the apply path already reads
   `accruedRequestFees`/`reservedRequestFees`/`withdrawableFees`/`getMiniAppCount`
   and probes `getMiniApp`; then run `REBUILD_APPLY=1` (5 registered miniapps as of
   2026-06-11). Afterwards spot-check `withdrawAccruedFees` gating: a withdraw of
   more than `withdrawableFees()` must FAULT with
   `"amount exceeds withdrawable (unreserved) fees"`.

## Mainnet legacy duplicates (expected backfill output)

Three registered apps share one callback contract
(`vrf-e2e`, `http-e2e`, `compute-e2e` -> `0xe1226268f2fe08bea67fb29e1c8fda0d7c8e9844`).
The backfill is **first-wins** (registration order), mirroring the deployed O(n)
resolver's earliest-registered-wins semantics, so `vrf-e2e` keeps the mapping and the
script reports the other two as "legacy duplicate record(s) correctly skipped". This
is NOT an error. Post-upgrade implications:

- `http-e2e`/`compute-e2e` can no longer reconfigure while KEEPING the shared
  callback (`"callback already registered"`); they must move to their own consumer
  contracts (they never received legacy-callback routing anyway).
- A duplicate that repoints away does NOT clear the winner's mapping (owner-checked
  delete; covered by `MorpheusOracleCallbackIndexTests`).
- Callback squatting is recoverable: the SYSTEM admin can always `configureMiniApp`
  a squatter's callback to null, releasing the mapping.

## Rollback

Rollback = `update` again with the PREVIOUS artifact. The script archives the
current on-chain state BEFORE every run (dry or apply) to
`private-backups/upgrades/morpheus-oracle.<network>.uc<N>.<timestamp>.{nef,manifest.json,contractstate.json}` -
the `.nef` is reconstructed byte-exact (checksum-validated against the on-chain
value). To roll back:

```sh
cp private-backups/upgrades/morpheus-oracle.<network>.uc0.<ts>.nef      contracts/build/MorpheusOracle.nef
cp private-backups/upgrades/morpheus-oracle.<network>.uc0.<ts>.manifest.json contracts/build/MorpheusOracle.manifest.json
UPGRADE_APPLY=1 MORPHEUS_ORACLE_ADMIN_WIF=... node scripts/upgrade-morpheus-oracle.mjs --network <network>
```

Then restore the current build with `contracts/build.sh`. Storage writes made by the
new generation (reserved-fee ledger `0x26`, callback index `0x27`, account membership
`0x28`) are simply ignored by the old code (it never reads those prefixes), so a
rollback is state-safe. Do NOT roll back after fees have been reserved AND withdrawn
under the new accounting without checking `accruedRequestFees >= reservedRequestFees`
first (the old code has no reserve and would allow draining pending-request backing
again - the original finding).

## Storage compatibility (analysis summary)

The upgrade reuses the deployed storage layout unchanged: all pre-existing prefixes
(`0x01`-`0x25`) keep their key encodings and value formats. The three new prefixes
(`0x26` reserved fees, `0x27` callback index keyed by the callback `UInt160` 20-byte
LE bytes -> appId string, `0x28` account membership) start empty and are populated by
new submissions and `rebuildIndexes`. The callback-uniqueness assert adds only a read
+ revert on the existing `0x27` prefix - no stored value is reinterpreted.
